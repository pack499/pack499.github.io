      <description>A part of cubscouting cost is pack dues. The pack dues are for buying the supplies, conducting den, pack events/activities, awards and recognitions, unit renewal cost, and anything that you observe as an operational expense during the den and pack meetings for the group in a scout calendar year. For this year (2024-2025), the dues are $75 per scout and $60 for every additional registered sibling in cubscout.
Pack dues doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover the cost of camping and any major outdoor events that require campsite / event registration fee with third parities.</description>

      <description>The Alka-Seltzer pop rocket experiment is a fun and simple science activity that demonstrates principles of chemical reactions, gas production, and Newton&amp;rsquo;s Third Law of Motion. This experiment involves creating a small &amp;ldquo;rocket&amp;rdquo; using common household items: Alka-Seltzer tablets, water, and a film canister or similar container with a tight-fitting lid.</description>

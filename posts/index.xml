      <description>Assalamualaikum Pack499!,
Alhamdulillah, it was great to see many Cubscouts showed-up today to kickstart the next scouting year.
There is a lot of excitement about the Popcorn Sale. The event will be beneficial and successful with your participation, inshaAllah.
Please note while the event brings excitement, it comes with considerable background planning in advance and the efforts continue until the sale concludes. The first step in making it successful is through a near accurate forecast of upcoming year (2025-26) returning scouts and their commitment.</description>
